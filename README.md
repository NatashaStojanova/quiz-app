This is a simple and engaging quiz app built using React. It uses reusable components, modern state management, and a consistent design system.

## How to Start the Application

  

1. ****Clone the repository:****

```bash

git clone git@github.com:NatashaStojanova/quiz-app.git

```

2. ****Install dependencies:****

```bash

npm install

```

3. ****Run the development server:****

```bash

npm run dev

```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`.

### Branch Structure

This project uses two branches to organize development and ensure stability:

1. **`dev` Branch:**
   - All feature development and bug fixes are committed to this branch.
   - Used for ongoing work and testing.

2. **`main` Branch:**
   - Contains the final, stable version of the code.
   - Only code reviewed from the `dev` branch is merged into `main`.

# Quiz Logic

- **User Name Input**:
  - User enters their name.
  - Empty or whitespace only names are not allowed.
  - If a user tries to access `/quiz` without entering a name, they will be redirected to the welcome screen.

- **Preparation Screen**:
  - A preparation screen with a countdown is displayed before the quiz starts.
  - After the countdown, the quiz begins.

- **Quiz Questions**:
  - The quiz consists of 10 randomly generated questions about languages, countries, and continents.
  - Questions are structured to avoid consecutive questions of the same type (handled by a GraphQL transformation function).

- **Quiz timer**:
  - Each question has a 15 second timer.
  - When time runs out:
    - A warning displays, and the correct answer is revealed.
    - Automatically proceeds to the next question.
  - If the user answers within the time limit:
    - They can navigate back to view previous results or forward to the next question.

- **Progress Tracking**:
  - A progress bar is updated after each question (whether correct or not).
  - Displays the current question number out of the total (Example: 3/10).

- **End of Quiz**:
  - Redirects to a results screen.
    - Total score.
    - Option to retake the quiz or view the leaderboard.

- **Navigation Rules**:
  - Users cannot navigate back or forward until they answer the current question.
  - After answering navigation is allowed.

# Routes

The `/routes` folder contains constants for all routes in the application, making navigation easy and maintainable:

- ****Welcome screen:**** `/`

- ****Quiz screen:**** `/quiz`

- ****Results screen:**** `/results`

- ****Leaderboard screen:**** `/leaderboard`



This structure keeps all route definitions in one place, making it easier to update or add routes in the future.

## Main Features

  

### Reusable Components

- The application uses modular and reusable components, such as `Button`, `Input`, and `Table`. These are located in the `/components` folder.

- Each component has its own `index.tsx` (for logic) and `style.ts` (for styling) and optionally `utils.ts` for utilities, making them easy to maintain and update.

- Props allow you to configure dimensions, colors, spacing, and alignment dynamically.

  

### Centralized theme

- The `/theme` folder contains a centralized design system with:

- ****Predefined spacing:**** (`sm`, `md`, `lg`) for uniform padding and margins.

- ****Colors:**** Standardized palette for consistent UI elements.

- ****Why use a theme?****

- Ensures consistency throughout the application.

- Makes adding or changing design elements scalable and easy.

  

### State management

- ****React Context API**** is used for global state management (like the name and score).

- ****LocalStorage**** ensures that leaderboard data is saved even when you refresh or close the application.

  

### Animations

- ****GSAP (GreenSock)**** is used to add smooth animations to the app, such as scaling and button bouncing on the results page, timer and right or wrong answer display.

  

### Simple validation

- Instead of using libraries like Formik or Yup, simple validation is done directly in the code, since the app only needs minimal validation (example: checking if the name is provided).

## Project structure

  

### File organization

- ******`/components`**:**** Contains all reusable components (Example: `Button`, `Card`, `Table`, `Text`, `Input`, `Divider`....).

- ******`/context`**:**** Includes the `UserContext` file for managing global state.

- ******`/pages`**:**** Contains the main pages of the application:

- `WelcomePage`: Displays the landing page where users can enter their name and start the quiz.

- `ResultsPage`: Displays the users quiz results with animations.

- `LeaderboardPage`: Displays a list of top scores.

- ******`/routes`**:**** Manages application routes to keep navigation logic separate.

- ******`/theme`**:**** Defines the theme system for consistent colours, spacing and styles.

- **`/context`**: Includes the `UserContext` file for managing global state.

- **`/models`**: Contains types and interfaces used across the project.

- **`/hooks`**: Contains custom hooks for encapsulating reusable logic.

- **`/helpers`**: Contains helper functions that are shared between different parts of the project.

### Functional components

- The application uses only functional components for consistency, except for the `ErrorBoundary` component (React currently does not have a clean way to implement an error boundary using functional components and class component was used for this specific case.)
